interesting mechanics to have:
	1. an inventory system: gamify the scan-capture-learn loop further by making the player manage inventory
	2. in-game codex: diversify narrative approaches
	3. ship health: the player should have a lot of ways to destroy their ship causing a game-over
	4. terrain scan: instead of just staring at a bunch of boxes on the scree, the player should be able to also scan terrain as part of the navigation
		puzzle

on the fence about:
	1. real-time combat: combat is the simplest way to introduce strategy into gameplay, but why would a deep-sea excavation ship fight?
	2. nemsis chase mechanism: I fucking hate this but it fits the tone

need to figure out:
	1. how should the game progress at all?
